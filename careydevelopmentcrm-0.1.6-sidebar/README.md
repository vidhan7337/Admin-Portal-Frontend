# careydevelopmentcrm
This is an ongoing project that demonstrates how to build a customer relationship management (CRM) application
using Angular, Spring Boot, and MongoDB.

Each lesson is a separate branch. The latest state of the whole project is in the master branch.

If you're interested in following the guides, just view the 
<a href="https://careydevelopment.us/tag/careydevelopmentcrm" target="_blank">careydevelopmentcrm</a>
tag on the Carey Development website. Note that all lessons are in reverse chronological order 
so if you want to start at the beginning, go to the last page.

DON'T FORGET TO INSTALL THE DEPENDENCIES! You can do that easily by opening a command prompt, going to
the directory where this project is located, and typing:

npm install

That's it. That should do it.

If you're still having issues, you might need to blow away everything in the node_modules directory
run npm install again.
